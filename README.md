# Endless-Runner-Challenge.
Python Project Made by Alish Tuladhar.

"Endless Runner Challenge" is a fast-paced and addictive game where players control a character through an endless obstacle course. You must choose between medium and difficult levels, avoiding obstacles while collecting points. The game offers the option to play again or exit after each game-over scenario, challenging players to achieve higher scores. Unfortunately I have removed easy mode because in easy mode, we wont end the game even we are not doing anything ðŸ¤£ so i replaced easy mode with medium mode. (i.e. More commit)

So, play the game and tell us your highest score. Enjoy!!
